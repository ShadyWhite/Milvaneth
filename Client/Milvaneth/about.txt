Milvaneth Client

软件说明：
    Milvaneth 计划，取名自乌尔达哈的密尔瓦内斯礼拜堂，是中国版本的跨服市场信息共享平台。由于国服目前没有手机 App，Milvaneth 计划独立研发了一套新的物价获取技术，并将在 App 发布时尽快支持通过 App 接口获取物价信息。
    本软件将会在玩家浏览交易板及操作雇员时收集市场数据，并将这些数据与其他用户共享，以期为全体用户提供更长时间、更大范围和跨服务器的物价数据，此外本软件及关联项目还会利用统计学方法和图表自动归纳与呈现这些信息，从而为玩家进行游戏内的交易活动提供便利。
    国际服存在类似的项目 mogboard.com，与本项目的功能基本相同但开发时间更长，因此功能较本项目更加完善。此项目目前正稳定运行中。

    本项目目前采用点对点的共享原则，即所有用户均有权访问由全体用户上传数据所构成的数据池，但在此过程中用户需要相应地上传一定量的有效数据，以维持项目的正常运行。如果您被认定存在滥用或攻击行为，将可能被拒绝使用本项目。
    本软件不会提供任何可以进行“自动交易”或“游戏外交易”的功能，目前亦不提供任何形式的“触发器”或“游戏外提醒”功能。所有数据相对游戏客户端都是只读的，不具备任何形式的写入功能。

    Milvaneth 是一个公开公益项目，对全体中国地区《最终幻想14》玩家免费开放使用，并可能会在正式运营后接受捐赠。本项目在可预见的未来中不会采用任何形式的收费制。但，出于运行成本或者个人经济状况限制，不排除在不损害既有免费用户权益的情况下推出增值服务的可能。
    Milvaneth 采取部分开源的策略，您可以在 https://github.com/menphina/ 查看本客户端所使用的部分源码。

问题反馈：
    您可以在此提出 Issue：https://github.com/menphina/Milvaneth/issues
    或发信至此邮箱：milvaneth@bug.is
    由于可能存在的消息查阅延迟，我们不推荐您从贴吧或 NGA 进行反馈

隐私权声明：
    为了维持本软件正常运转的需要，本软件需要收集、上传并共享一部分在玩家与游戏客户端交互过程中产生的数据，包括但不限于：市场概览、物价数据、交易历史数据、雇员信息、制作者姓名与编号、角色等级信息等。使用本软件即视为您同意本项目对进行上述信息的收集、上传与共享行为。
    可能会同其他用户共享的信息包括：市场概览、物价数据、交易历史数据、雇员名、制作者姓名等。这些信息的详细程度不会超出玩家在游戏内所能查阅的程度，但可能在时间和空间尺度上大于游戏内可以取得的范围，并可能以与游戏内不同的方式呈现。
    在未经用户同意的情况下，本软件不会以任何形式通过任何手段收集或上传非游戏客户端交互产生的数据，且不会以任何理由强迫您同意收集这些信息的行为。您可以自愿许可本软件进行前述内容的收集与上传，并可在任意时间收回该许可。这些内容将仅包括 Advanced Combat Tracker 的使用数据（不含详细战斗记录和技能使用信息）与国际服客户端的安装状况（不含使用数据）。

    本软件不会收集、上传或共享任何可用于推导或识别游戏账户名、游戏登陆密码、游戏密码找回方式或玩家真实身份的数据。也不会在任何情况下要求您提供这些数据。

安全警示：
    本软件不会通过任何方式修改或增删游戏数据，亦不会对游戏程序及其网络连接进行信息的修改或增删，但本软件依旧存在被游戏客户端反作弊技术识别的风险。

免责声明：
    本软件按“原样”提供，不提供任何明示或暗示的保证，包括但不限于适销性、特定用途的适用性和不侵权的保证。使用本软件的风险由用户自行承担，在适用法律允许的最大范围内，对因使用或不能使用本软件所产生的损害及风险，包括但不限于直接或间接的个人损害、商业赢利的丧失、贸易中断、商业信息的丢失或任何其它经济损失，作者或版权所有者均不承担任何责任。
