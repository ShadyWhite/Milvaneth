# Milvaneth

Project Milvaneth, named after [Milvaneth Sacrarium in Ul'dah](https://ffxiv.gamerescape.com/wiki/Milvaneth_Sacrarium), is the Chinese version of cross-world market infomation sharing platform (just like mogboard.com). Which, since there is currently no Companion App available for Chinese players (though Live Letter CN said it's WIP months ago), Milvaneth will develop a separate market data fetching technology, and will support Companion App CN API as soon as possible once it is released.

# Open source policy

Due to the possibility of abuse of related technologies, Milvaneth will adopt a semi-open source strategy:

1. Dual-use components, such as memory analyzers and some other components, will have access restrictions on source code and apply anti-reverse engineering measures on object code.

2. Implementations of predictive or statistical algorithms, if any, will be open source if the algorithm itself has been made public.

3. Components that do not meet the above criteria will be open source.

# About the service

Milvaneth service will be public available and free-to-use. It may accept donations after formal operation.

Since players in CN region do not need to pay for the base game and expansion packs, and per-account cost is $0.09/hr playtime. The estimated operating cost of Milvaneth will be lower than similar services in JP/US/EU regions.

# Time frame
